# Bad Apple in Acii (another implementation)
This is a simple implementation of classic bad apple video, transformed to ascii and displayed on terminal, this script should work on any operating system, including windows.

# How to Run 

First you must verify that you have python installed, any version of python since 3.10 works!!, you will also need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
I highly recommend running this using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) you must [install poetry first ](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) 
Then, you need to install dependencies.

```bash
poetry install  
```

and then you only need to run and enjoy using 

```bash
poetry run python -m start
```

If you want use pip instead poetry, you need to run 

```bash
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

and 

```bash
python -m start
```
