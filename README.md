# Bad Apple in Ascii (another implementation)
This is a simple implementation of classic bad apple video, transformed to ascii and displayed on terminal, this script should work on any operating system, including windows.

# How to Run 

First, you need to install ffmpeg, in your SO.
then, you must verify that you have python installed, any version of python since 3.10 works!!, you will also need to install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
I highly recommend running this using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) you must [install poetry first ](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) 
Then, you need to install dependencies.

```bash
poetry install  
```

and then you only need to run and enjoy using 

```bash
poetry run python -m start
```

If you want use pip instead poetry, you need to run 

```bash
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

and 

```bash
python -m start
```
